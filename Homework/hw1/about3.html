                C++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, <br />
                bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others.<br />
                Almost all operators can be overloaded for user-defined types, with a few notable <br />
                exceptions such as member access (. and .*) as well as the conditional operator. <br />
                The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types <br />
                in C++ seem like built-in types.<br />
                
                <br /><br />
                
                Overloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming <br />
                techniques, such as smart pointers. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence <br />
                of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the<br />
                operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, <br />
                though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded "&&" and "||" operators <br />
                lose their short-circuit evaluation property.<br />
